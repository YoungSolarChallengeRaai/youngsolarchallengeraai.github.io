On this Saturday we had our annual Kick-off event. During the event FIRST revealed this year’s FIRST
Robotics Competition Infinite Recharge. We came together with our team to watch the reveal and
discuss our strategy for the coming season. Over the next 6 weeks different we will work together to
overcome challenges while building a robot that can accurately shoot balls, balance a switch by
hanging on it and rotate a panel.

We are excited to show you more in the coming weeks and hope you will follow along as we share
more of our journey.

You can find a brief explanation of this year’s challenge in [this video][game-video] and for those looking for a
more in depth look there is the [game manual][game-manual]
