  Today we showed our robots to the contestants and visitors of the FLL Regional in Leeuwarden. Everybody was able to try our robots and we told them about FRC!

At the FLL regional are a lot of children from primary and middle school, the contestants are aged 9 to 14. In the Netherlands a lot of FLL teams don't know that there are other FIRST programs so for them it ends by the FIRST Lego League.

We would really like that this would change so that's why we promote FRC at different FLL regionals in the Netherlands. At this event there was also a FTC team called [Pretty Smart Robotics][pretty-smart-site]. So at this event there were a lot of different teams from different FIRST programs and we think that's really cool!

Besides the fact we told people about FRC we also helped the organisation of the regional with judging and packing after the event!
