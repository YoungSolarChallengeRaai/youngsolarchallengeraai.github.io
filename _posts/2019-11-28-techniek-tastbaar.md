  Techniek Tastbaar is an event for children where they can have a look at technology in the grown-up world. As you might have guessed, Impossible Robotics was present too!

In the past month, our team has not been busy with any competitions. Instead, we have been working on getting publicity. Nope, not for our team, but for technology in general. And that is why we’ve been helping at Techniek Tastbaar in our province Friesland.

Techniek Tastbaar is an event for children aged 10 to 16, where they can have a first glimpse of technology in the grown-up world. They get lots of information from all kinds of different businessess, about jobs and career oppurtunities, but the most important goal of the event is to make these children enthusiastic about thechnology. After all, thechnology is the future.

Many kinds of different professions are presented: from the army, to the truck drivers, from the painters to the carpenters and from the welders to the mechanics. And of course, there is us, the Robotics team.

We were there to let children meet with our side of technology. To show that technology can be more than for example being a mechanic, or sitting at a desk all day, working behind a computer. It can also be working in a team to accomplish goals, building a robot and competing in competitions! We brought some of our robots: _Armstrong_, _Victor_ and our newest First Global robot. Certainly everyone could try them out!

It was very enjoyable, showing everyone what we’re doing and especially teaching them a bit about how some of our robots work. Hopefully we have shown that there are multiple sides of technology and that it can be a lot of fun!
